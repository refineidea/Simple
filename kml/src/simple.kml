<!--
		Simple is a lightweight all-around skin for krpano panoramic player.
		And yes, it's about simplicity in "Apple way". Less is more.
	
		The first and biggest thing to mention: it's Adobe Flash free from now and forever.

		It offers (in plans)
			* VR-first design; 
			* mobile-second;
			* desktop-third;
			* mixed 360-photo and 360-video in tour;
			* basic navigation features i.e. hotspots, thumbs;
			* gallery for images (working nicely everywhere);
			* customizable iframe integration;
			* sequencer;
			* scenario manager for advanced automatic panoraming.
